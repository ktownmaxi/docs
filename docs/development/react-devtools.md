To install React Developer Tools in Spotify:

1. Launch Spotify in the developer mode (and with the `--enable-chrome-runtime` flag if you are using **Spotify versions older than 1.2.34**; without it, React Developer Tools won't work)
2. Press *Ctrl + Shift + T*
3. Press *Ctrl + N*
4. Navigate to the React Developer Tools page on Chrome Web Store using the address bar: `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi`
5. Press the "Add to Chrome" button
6. Confirm your choice

You may need to press *F5* to get the extension working.

If you get an error saying that you're not allowed to install extensions, try using this switch: `--allowlisted-extension-id=fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi`.

You can find more info about React Developer Tools on the [official React website](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools).
